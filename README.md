# Quantum Machine Learning

Within this repository, you'll find tutorials and exercises focused on applications of quantum machine learning. Organized into three distinct folders, each houses a tutorial focused on a specific quantum machine learning algorithm. These tutorials are presented as Jupyter notebooks, accompanied by their respective datasets.

## GitHub content

These are the main tutorials that you can find in this GitHub repo:

+ **QSVM tutorial**: In this tutorial, we will explore examples of quantum-enhanced support vector machines. The task will be to classify a breast cancer dataset.

+ **QNN tutorial**: This tutorial aims to generate an explicable quantum machine learning method to automate disgnostics for mental health conditions. In this example, we will be working with an Autisitc Spectrum Disorder dataset, which consists of a set of binary answers to questionnaires. With such answers, our aim is to predict the probability of having ASD. A Quantum Neural Network will be used to make the predictions.

+ + **QRC tutorial**: In this tutorial, we are going to use quantum reservoir computing to forecast stock prices.
